# Triage Triumph
Triage Triumph is a Python-based game/simulation designed to help medical professionals evaluate triage situations. It replicates/creates emergency room scenarios in which patient conditions must be assessed and prioritized based on their severity. 
The project aims to enhance hospitals' ability to allocate patients appropriately and, through repeated use, become more proficient in making critical decisions. It will also serve as study tool for healthcare professionals. 

This project's contributors are Katherine Chadwick and Ashleen Randhawa.
