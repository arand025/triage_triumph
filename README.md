# Triage Triumph
Triage Triumph is a Python-based game designed to help evaluate triage situations. Triaging is when a medical professional preforms a preliminary evaluation of a patient so that they can determine the urgency of the patient's situation. This is a critical step in ensuring patients with serious injuries or illness are treated promptly while controlling the flow of patients in the practice. Without triaging, patients could potentially wait for hours to be seen by a physician, all while their conditions continue to worsen. 

The game is comprised of multiple choice and true/false questions. Players will be presented with situations where they must triage patients based on the symptoms and their severity. The aim is to enhance medical professoinal's ability to allocate patients appropriately and, through repeated use, become more proficient in making critical decisions. This way, when presented with a real-world triaging scenario, the player will be able to quickly identify a patient's needs.
