# Triage Triumph
Triage Triumph is a Python-based game designed to help evaluate triage situations. Triaging is when a medical professional performs a preliminary evaluation of a patient to determine the urgency of the patient's situation. This is a critical step in ensuring patients with serious injuries or illnesses are treated promptly while controlling the flow of patients in the practice. Without triaging, patients could potentially wait hours to be seen by a physician, all while their conditions worsen. 

The game is comprised of multiple choice and true/false questions. Players will be presented with situations where they must triage patients based on their symptoms and severity. The aim is to enhance medical professional's ability to allocate patients appropriately and, through repeated use, become more proficient in making critical decisions. This way, when presented with a real-world triaging scenario, the player can quickly identify a patient's needs.
